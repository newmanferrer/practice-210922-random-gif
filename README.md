# PRACTICE: RANDOM GIF APP

## Project description

The goal of this lab is to improve the concepts of requests to rest apis through efficient typing using typescript. Similarly improve skills related to testing our applications using Jest, React Testing Library and Mock Service Worker

### Important note:

for obvious reasons the Giphy api key will not be delivered, you must obtain one and place it in the api service in the path: src/services/giphyApi/giphyApi.ts. In the same way in the tests that require it, such as in the "useGifURL.test.ts" file, which is located in the path: src/hooks/useGifURL/useGifURL.test.ts, also in the file "handlers.ts", in the patc: src/mocks/handlers.ts
